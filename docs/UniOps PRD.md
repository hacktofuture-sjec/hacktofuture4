# UniOps PRD

* **Product Requirements Document**  
* **Version:** 1.1 (28-Hour Hackathon Edition – Post-Mentorship)  
* **Date:** April 15, 2026  
* **Project Name:** UniOps – Small OS for Operations  
* **Hackathon:** DevOps Hackathon (Reva University – Team 07\)

**Hackathon Duration:** 28 hours (compressed from original 36-hour plan)

---

### **1\. Executive Summary**

UniOps is an **agentic “Small OS for Operations”** purpose-built for DevOps/SRE teams to eliminate toil and drastically reduce cognitive load. It unifies fragmented operational knowledge — primarily Confluence/runbooks (single source of truth), GitHub PRs/changes, simulated incident data (ServiceNow-style), Slack threads, and tribal knowledge — into one transparent, auditable, human-controlled intelligent system.

* **Core Architecture (updated post-mentorship):**  
* Controller Kernel \+ Dynamic Swarms \+ **Native** Permission Gates (HITL-first) \+ Three-Tier Memory \+ Kairos

(Strong emphasis on **transparency** — full chain-of-thought \+ data-point citations — and **plug-and-play data sources** as advised by mentors.)

* **Vision (directly from mentor feedback):**

SREs/Platform Engineers ask natural-language questions (“Why did Redis latency spike last week?” or “Run the standard high-CPU runbook on service X safely”) → UniOps retrieves from Confluence/runbooks \+ GitHub history \+ simulated incidents → shows **live reasoning trace with exact sources** → proposes safe actions → **executes only after explicit human approval**.

* **Hackathon Goal (28-hour MVP):**

Deliver a fully functional, demo-ready product that clearly beats partial solutions (HolmesGPT, OpenSRE, Port.io, Rootly) in **knowledge unification, radical transparency, native human-in-the-loop safety**, and **realistic DevOps toil reduction**. Stack redesigned for lower cost and MVP stability (Milvus instead of Chroma; GraphRAG kept lightweight).

**Key Mentor-Driven Changes Incorporated:**

* Prioritize Confluence/runbooks as single source of truth \+ GitHub change history over pure Slack.  
* Simulate ServiceNow-style incidents for realism (not just GitHub Actions).  
* Strong focus on **transparency** (chain-of-thought \+ data points used).  
* **Native HITL** Permission Gate (no non-native implementation).  
* Vector store switched to **Milvus** (enterprise-ready; Chroma risk noted by Mentor 2).  
* Plug-and-play data source philosophy.  
* Acknowledge tribal knowledge exists (\~10% of enterprises) but is secondary.

  ### **2\. Problem Statement (Source of Truth: Mentorship Transcript)**

Engineering teams (especially SREs/DevOps) lose hours daily because:

* Operational knowledge lives in Confluence (single source), runbooks/playbooks, GitHub PRs, Slack threads, and occasional tribal knowledge (forgotten fixes).  
* Context switching between tools is painful even when documentation exists.  
* Incident response often requires hunting history of changes, feature flags, or customer-specific customizations.  
* Existing tools are either telemetry-heavy or lack deep multi-agent reasoning \+ strong human-in-the-loop.  
* GitHub Actions alone is too ephemeral/limited; real value is in production incidents and change history.

Mentor insight: In well-documented teams, knowledge hunting is “very quick” for known errors, but still painful for new issues or customer-specific customizations. Tribal knowledge exists in \~10% of enterprises.

### **3\. Solution Overview**

**Core Metaphor:** UniOps is a lightweight “Small OS” running inside your engineering workspace.

* **Controller (Kernel)** → single entry point, spawns swarms, enforces native safety.  
* **Dynamic Swarms** → Retrieval, Reasoning, Execution agents working in parallel.  
* **Native Permission Gate** → every external action requires explicit human approval \+ full audit trail \+ chain-of-thought visibility.  
* **Three-Tier Memory** → MEMORY.MD index → Markdown runbooks/Confluence → JSON transcripts.  
* **Kairos (autoDream)** → background agent that maintains memory hygiene and deduplication.  
* **Live Reasoning Trace** → real-time SSE stream showing every thought → tool → observation \+ exact data sources cited.  
* **Frontend** → clean Next.js chat \+ trace panel \+ approval modal.

**Post-Mentorship Focus:** Plug-and-play data ingestion (Confluence \+ GitHub \+ simulated incidents first) and radical transparency so engineers can trust (and audit) every conclusion.

4. Multi-agent swarm orchestration (Controller → Swarms)  
5. **Native** Permission Gate \+ Human approval modal for every action  
6. Safe planner-only tool execution planning (GitHub PR comment/create rollback, Slack post, Jira update)  
7. Three-Tier Memory with basic Kairos (deduplication)  
8. Audit log of every agent step \+ data sources used

**Nice-to-have (if time)**

* Lightweight Neo4j graph for service/feature-flag dependencies (Phase 2\)

  ### **5\. Target Users & Use Cases (Mentor-Validated Demo Flows)**

**Primary User:** SRE / Platform Engineer / On-call Developer

**Key Use Cases (Demo Flows – directly inspired by transcript):**

1. “Explain the high Redis latency incident from last week” (pulls from Confluence runbook \+ GitHub changes \+ simulated incident)  
2. “Run the standard high-CPU runbook on service X” (retrieves runbook, shows steps, asks for approval before any planner-only execution)  
3. “Create a rollback PR for the last deployment, post to Slack, and update Jira” (full human approval flow \+ audit)  
4. “Summarise tribal knowledge \+ Confluence notes from recent Slack thread about customer XYZ feature flag”

   ### **6\. Technical Architecture (High-Level – Redesigned per Mentor 2\)**

* **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router) \+ Tailwind \+ shadcn/ui \+ EventSource (SSE)  
* **Backend:** FastAPI \+ Python 3.12  
* **Orchestration:** Custom Small OS (Controller \+ Swarms) on LangGraph patterns  
* **LLM:** Groq (primary) \+ Apfel local fallback (M1)  
* **Knowledge Layer:** LlamaIndex \+ **Milvus** (vector store – replaced Chroma per mentor advice) \+ SimpleDirectoryReader for markdown/Confluence export  
* **Memory:** Three-tier system \+ Common Swarm Memory  
* **Safety:** **Native** PermissionGate \+ approval queue (HITL-first)  
* **Observability:** SSE live trace \+ structured audit logs (every data point cited)

**Cost & Stability Note:** Hybrid GraphRAG kept lightweight. Milvus chosen for enterprise-readiness and to avoid Chroma \+ GraphRAG breakage risk highlighted by Mentor 2\.
